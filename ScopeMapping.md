# Scope Mapping
The purpose of this document is to allow ease of scoping when commiting.

Folders (*e.g. Frontend-Mentor*) that have nested projects will have a Scope Mapping document to further define the scope

| Project | Value |
|---|---|
|Root|0|
| Design-Course-Crash-Course | 1 | 
| Frontend-Mentor | 2 |
| Udemy | 3 |
