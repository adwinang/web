# Scope Mapping

The purpose of this document is to allow ease of scoping when commiting.

Folders (_e.g. Frontend-Mentor_) that have nested projects will have a Scope Mapping document to further define the scope

| Project                    | Value |
| -------------------------- | ----- |
| Root                       | 0     |
| Design-Course-Crash-Course | 1     |
| Frontend-Mentor            | 2     |
| Udemy                      | 3     |
| Tutorial                   | 4     |
